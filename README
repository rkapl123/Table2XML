Table2XML version 1.41
======================

table2xml is an algorithm having two functions that allow the conversion of tabular data to XML
without using XSLT. This is achieved by reverting the "Flattener" methodology used by Microsoft Excel
to convert the XML tree format to a two-dimensional table
(see Opening XML Files in Excel and INFO: Microsoft Excel 2002 and XML).

This reversion is achieved by:

1. (possibly) modifying the flattened table a bit to enable a simpler processing of the data,

2. sequentially processing the data column- and row wise. 

The whole algorithm is done without the aid of any XML library, so it lends itself to easy translation
into other environments and languages.

For producing the XML, first, we need to invoke parseHeaderForXML, using a (the first?) line with the rootnode and path information.
After parsing the header info, the table data can be processed row by row by calling addXMLLine.
The current data row is provided in the single argument lineData, and the built XML string returned and can be concatenated..
A final call to addXMLLine restores the static variables and finalizes the XML string (closes any open tags).
